# TMDB-Movie-Dataset-Analysis

This data analysis investigates information about 10000 movies collected from the movie database (TMDb). 
By analyzing this data set, I answered these questions:

*which generes were mostly used over time? 

*What were the relationship between movies budget and profit making?

*What were the name of top ten popular movies and top ten directors based on movies popularity? 

*What were the revenue of movies had top 10 directors?


For answering these questions, I mainly used Pandas library to convert CSV file to dataframe and then performed data assessing, cleaning and visualization. Data cleaning included droping duplicates and redundant columns and repalacing null values with zero. Different kinds of plots like pie, bar and line plots were used to visualize data.
